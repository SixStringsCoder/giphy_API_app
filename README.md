#### Introduction

**Title**: Gotta Gif It

by Steve Hanlon

*Gotta Gif It* is a web app that displays animated GIFs and GIF Stickers supplied by [Giphy.com's API](https://developers.giphy.com/)

An API get request is made using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to return 24 GIFs that match the search query provided by the user.

The **Search** interface has a search input at top which is used to retrieve search results via the Giphy API call.  It then displays all images. I've implemented [w3schools toggle switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) which sets the Request URL to GIFs or Stickers.
